## **2. Research Questions**

* **RQ1:** …
* **RQ2:** …
* **RQ3:** …

---

## **3. Data Description**

* **Method:** Interviews / focus groups / open-ended survey responses
* **Participants:** N = __ (basic description only)
* **Data Format:**

  * `/transcripts/` – anonymised interview transcripts
  * `/codes/` – codebook, coding structure
  * `/themes/` – thematic summaries & matrices

> *All data has been anonymised in accordance with ethical guidelines.*

## **4. Analysis Approach**

We used a qualitative thematic analysis process based on:

1. Familiarisation
2. Initial coding
3. Developing themes
4. Reviewing and refining themes
5. Synthesising insights

Tools used (edit as needed):

* NVivo / Atlas.ti / manual coding
* Excel / Miro for sorting and clustering codes
